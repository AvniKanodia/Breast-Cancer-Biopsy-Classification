# Breast Cancer Biopsy Classification

In this project, I have tried to build an a binary classification model using Python to predict whether a breast cancer biopsy sample is malignant or benign. For this I have used a dataset called the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set which consists of 569 biopsy samples from breast cancer tumors. This model will help diagnos a biopsy sample by taking into account factors like the cells' Preimeter, Area, Radius, Texture, Smoothness etc. 

To make predicitions, I have mainly utilized five models:
  
  Approach 1: Linear Regression
  
  Approach 2: Boundary classifier
  
  Approach 3: Logistic Regression
  
  Approach 4: Multiple Feature Logistic Regression
  
  Approach 5: Decision Tree Model
  
At the end, I have also used multiple classifiers to make predictions to see which one of those gives the best precision, recall and accuracy. I have used pythin libraries like pandas, numpy and sklearn to build my models and other libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to visualize my results.
